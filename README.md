# GripperAI Web Application
This project is my first Web project. It is based on Flask.

###### Get started
To start the server locally follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Firstly clone the git repository into a local folder. (`git clone ...`)<br />
Secondly set up a virtual environment e.g. with virtualenv <br />
`pip install virtualenv`
`virtualenv my_virtualenvironment`
`source my_virtualenvironment/bin/activate`<br />
Then start the server locally<br />
`python server.py`<br />
